        "a1": "Our plan includes weekly updates of plugins, themes, and WordPress core, daily off-site cloud backups, 24/7 uptime monitoring, security scans, and small content updates.",
        "q2": "Do I really need a maintenance plan?",
        "a2": "Yes. Just like a car needs oil changes, a website needs maintenance. Without it, your site becomes vulnerable to hackers, slow, and may break when meaningful hosting updates occur.",
        "q3": "Can I cancel anytime?",
        "a3": "Absolutely. We believe in earning your business every month. There are no long-term lock-in contracts.",
        "q4": "What if my site gets hacked?",
        "a4": "If you are on our maintenance plan, we will fix your hacked site for free. We take preventing this very seriously."
