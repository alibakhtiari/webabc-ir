        "a1": "You receive a complete diagnostic of your website. This includes a 20+ minute video walkthrough where we analyze your site in real-time as a user, plus a detailed PDF report prioritizing issues by severity with specific, actionable recommendations on how to fix them.",
        "q2": "Can you implement the changes for me?",
        "a2": "Absolutely. While the audit is a standalone diagnostic service, many clients hire us afterwards to implement the recommended fixes. We can provide a separate quote for accurate execution of the optimization roadmap.",
        "q3": "How long does an audit take?",
        "a3": "A thorough manual audit takes time. We typically deliver your comprehensive video and report within 3-5 business days from booking.",
        "q4": "Is this useful for an old website?",
        "a4": "It is arguably *most* useful for established sites. If you have traffic but low sales, an audit often provides the highest ROI of any marketing investment by fixing the leaky bucket before you pour more water (ads) into it."
