## 1. Project Overview

4 Seasons Carpet Clean isn't just a service provider; it's a top-rated local brand in London's hyper-competitive cleaning market. My role was to build a digital ecosystem that dominates local search results (Map Pack) and maximizes Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) through automated marketing.

## 2. The Challenge

*   **Invisible in Local Search:** The business struggled to appear in the "Local Pack" (Google Maps top 3) for high-value keywords like "Carpet Cleaner Paddington."
*   **Low Retention:** While service quality was high, there was no system to turn one-time "emergency stain removal" clients into recurring seasonal customers.
*   **Data Inconsistency:** Inconsistent contact details across the web were hurting domain authority.

## 3. The Solution

### Technical Local SEO (The "Map Pack" Strategy)
*   **NAP Consistency Audit:** I executed a strict "Name, Address, Phone" (NAP) cleanup across all major directories (Yell, Yelp, Thomson Local). Ensuring identical data points across the web signaled trust to Google's local algorithm.
*   **Citation Building:** Built high-quality local citations on authoritative London-based directories to boost domain authority without risking spam penalties.
*   **GMB Optimization:** Fully optimized the Google Business Profile with geo-tagged images, service menus, and "Q&A" seeding to increase visibility in local proximity searches.

### Omnichannel Marketing Ecosystem
*   **Email Marketing Automation:** Set up automated "Seasonal Reminder" flows (e.g., "Spring Cleaning" or "6-Month Refresh") to re-engage past customers, turning single services into recurring revenue.
*   **Review Generation Loop:** Implemented an automated SMS/Email post-service sequence that requests reviews on Trustpilot and Google. This fueled the 240+ 5-star rating that now serves as the brand's main social proof.
*   **Content Localization:** Created hyper-local landing pages targeting specific boroughs (e.g., "Upholstery Cleaning Kensington") to capture long-tail search traffic.

### Conversion-Focused Development
*   **Trust Integration:** Embedded a live API feed of Trustpilot/Google reviews directly onto the hero section, instantly validating the brand to new visitors.
*   **Speed & Mobile:** Achieved <1s load times on mobile devices (where 80% of emergency cleaning searches happen) by serving next-gen image formats (WebP) for the heavy "Before/After" gallery.

## 4. Key Results

*   **Map Pack Domination:** Achieved top 3 visibility for core keywords in the target W2 postcode area.
*   **Review Velocity:** Automated prompts increased review intake by 40%, cementing the brand as the #1 rated service in the area.
*   **Repeat Business:** Email campaigns successfully reactivated 15% of the dormant customer base in the first quarter.
