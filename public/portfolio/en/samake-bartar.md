## 1. The Challenge: Technical Debt & Stagnant Growth

Samakebartar.com was running on a legacy Joomla architecture powered by an end-of-life version of PHP (7.x), creating significant security vulnerabilities. Beyond the security risks, the site was suffering from "invisible" SEO issues:

*   **Keyword Cannibalization:** Multiple pages were competing for the same search terms, confusing Google and diluting ranking power.
*   **Poor Performance:** Outdated code led to slow load times and low Core Web Vitals scores.
*   **Low Engagement:** The UX was outdated, resulting in a low Click-Through Rate (CTR) and poor conversion.

## 2. The Solution: Security-First Migration

We executed a full-scale migration from Joomla to a modern WordPress environment.

*   **Infrastructure Upgrade:** Moved from vulnerable PHP 7 to the bleeding-edge PHP 8.4, ensuring maximum security, speed, and future-proofing.
*   **Data Integrity:** Migrated thousands of database entries (content, users, media) with zero data loss.
*   **Hardened Security:** Eliminated legacy vulnerabilities inherent in the old Joomla installation.

## 3. SEO & Performance Overhaul

Migration was just the first step. We rebuilt the site's engine to rank higher and convert better.

*   **Fixed Keyword Cannibalization:** Audited the content map and consolidated competing pages. We set up proper 301 redirects to merge authority, clarifying the site structure for search engines.
*   **PageSpeed Optimization:** Achieved "Green" scores on Google PageSpeed Insights by implementing modern caching, image compression, and minifying the new PHP 8.4 compatible code.
*   **CTR Improvement:** Rewrote meta titles and descriptions to target user intent, resulting in higher visibility in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).

## 4. CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization)

Traffic is vanity; conversion is sanity. We redesigned key landing pages to focus on user action.

*   **Simplified User Journeys:** Reduced the number of clicks required to convert.
*   **Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs):** Placed strategically based on heat map data.

## 5. The Results

*   **Security:** 100% remediation of PHP 7 vulnerabilities.
*   **Performance:** PageSpeed score increased to 95+.
*   **Growth:** Organic traffic quality improved by resolving cannibalization issues.
*   **Tech:** Fully upgraded to PHP 8.4 standard.
