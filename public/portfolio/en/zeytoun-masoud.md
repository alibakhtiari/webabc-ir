## 1. Project Overview

Zeytoun Masoud is a premier producer of organic olive products based in Rudbar, the olive capital of the region. The goal was to transform a successful traditional brick-and-mortar business into a high-volume e-commerce brand that serves both retail customers and B2B wholesale buyers (hotels, restaurants).

## 2. The Challenge

*   **Regional Limitations:** The business was limited to foot traffic in Rudbar. They needed to reach a national audience without losing the "traditional/authentic" brand voice.
*   **Logistics Complexity:** Selling heavy, liquid-based food products (oils, pickles) requires specialized shipping logic to prevent breakage and calculate accurate delivery costs.
*   **Trust Barrier:** Users are often hesitant to buy food products online. The site needed to convey freshness and organic certification immediately.

## 3. The Solution

### E-commerce Architecture
*   **Hybrid B2B/B2C System:** Developed a dual-pricing infrastructure. Retail customers see standard pricing, while verified restaurant owners access a "Wholesale Portal" with bulk discounts and tax-exempt invoices.
*   **Dynamic Shipping Calculator:** Integrated a custom shipping algorithm that calculates costs based on weight tiers (vital for heavy olive oil tins) and distance, preventing profit loss on logistics.

### SEO & Content Strategy
*   **Niche Domination:** Targeted high-intent keywords like "Original Rudbar Olive" and "Cold Pressed Olive Oil."
*   **Educational Content Hub:** Built a "Blog" section that educates users on identifying pure olive oil (e.g., "Does Olive Oil Freeze?"). This captured informational traffic and positioned the brand as an honest authority, directly increasing conversion rates.

### Trust & Retention Marketing
*   **Social Proof Integration:** Displayed "Enamad" and "Samandehi" trust badges prominently in the footer and checkout to reduce friction.
*   **SMS Automation:** Implemented a transactional SMS system (via KavehNegar/IPPanel) to notify customers of order status, which is crucial for building trust in the local market.

## 4. Key Results

*   **National Reach:** Sales expanded from a single city to nationwide coverage within 6 months.
*   **Wholesale Growth:** The dedicated B2B portal onboarded 50+ major restaurant clients, creating a consistent recurring revenue stream.
*   **Organic Traffic:** Educational blog posts now rank #1 for key industry questions, driving free, high-quality traffic daily.
